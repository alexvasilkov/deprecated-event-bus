### Deprecated ###

This library is not supported, consider using Handler-based [Events](https://github.com/alexvasilkov/Events).

### Fluffy Events ###

Simple events bus ([publishâ€“subscribe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern)) implementation based on regular Android BroadcastReceivers mechanism.

#### Usage ####

First of all you should initialize EventsBus inside your Application class:

    public final class MyApplication extends Application {
        @Override
        public void onCreate() {
            super.onCreate();
            EventsBus.init(this);
        }
    }

To receive events you'll need to register a listener:

    int regId = EventsBus.register(listener);

When you're done listen to the events you need to unregister from events bus using `regId` value received from `register()` method:

    EventsBus.unregister(regId);

For activities it is recommended to register in the `onCreate()` (or in `onPostCreate()`) method and unregister in `onDestroy()` method.  
For fragments it is `onCreateView()` (`onViewCreated()`) and `onDestroyView()` methods respectively.  

Fluffy Events uses integer identifiers for events and Bundle as parameters holder.  
So it is recommended to declare you events ids and events parameters keys in `res/events.xml`:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <resources>

        <!-- Events ids -->
        <item type="id" name="my_event1"/>
        <item type="id" name="my_event2"/>

        <!-- Params keys -->
        <string name="param_message">message</string>

    </resources>

or to create separate java class with constants:

    public final class Events {

        public static final int MY_EVENT1 = 1;
        public static final int MY_EVENT2 = 2;

        public static final String PARAM_MESSAGE = "message";

    }

Now you can start using bus to send events:

    Bundle params = new Bundle();
    params.putString(Events.PARAM_MESSAGE, "Hello");
    EventsBus.send(Events.MY_EVENT1, params);

and to receive them in your registered listener:

    @Override
    public void onEvent(int eventId, Bundle params, boolean isBroadcasted) {
        switch (eventId) {
            case Events.MY_EVENT1:
                String msg = params.getString(Events.PARAM_MESSAGE);
                Toast.makeText(context, msg, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
                break;
        }
    }

Available methods:

    send(int eventId);

    send(int eventId, Bundle params);

    send(int eventId, String receiverId);

    send(int eventId, String receiverId, Bundle params);

    sendSticky(int eventId);

    sendSticky(int eventId, Bundle params);

    sendSticky(int eventId, String receiverId);

    sendSticky(int eventId, String receiverId, Bundle params);

#### How to build ####

You need [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) to build the project. Just run `mvn clean install` from project's root, jar file will be generated into `target` folder.
